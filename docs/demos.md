# Demo Notebooks

The [`demos`](/workspace/demos) folder contains example notebooks demonstrating how to use the `sparkhive-lab` environment effectively.

## Notebooks

- [**environ_demo.ipynb**](/workspace/demos/environ_demo.ipynb) — Showcases environment setup, with examples of how to save and load Delta tables.  
- [**wrangling_demo.ipynb**](/workspace/demos/wrangling_demo.ipynb) — Demonstrates common data wrangling techniques in PySpark.

## Usage

1. Start the Docker environment as described in the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart.md) guide.  
2. Open the notebook in either Jupyter Lab (`http://localhost:8888`) or connect via VS Code using the Jupyter extension.  
3. Run the notebooks step-by-step to explore the environment and learn basic PySpark workflows.
